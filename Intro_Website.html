   <center>  My name is Kevin Zelman, and I am an IT major focusing on security and networking expecting to graduate in May 2020.

   I am from Rahway, new Jersey.<br>

    <br>I am heavily intrigued by puzzles and Rubik's cubes. <br>

    <br>I work as a field technician in Manhattan for a company called MicroCare. 
    <br>In my free time, I like to listen to music and hang out with friends.<br>

    <br>I am taking this course because I feel like this class would help me understand more about how websites are structured and learn ways to further my education rather than just my required courses.
    <br>I have taken CIT 221 and 231, so I have some basic experience with SQL, HTML, CSS, Java, and Javascript. Outside of Pace, I coded for my high school robotics team in C++ and LabView.
    
   <br> I am interested in pursuing a career in Cyber-Security after I graduate Pace. I hope to become a Security Engineer or Architect, but I still have a lot to learn before either of those could ever happen.
