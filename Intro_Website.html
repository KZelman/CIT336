    <p>I work as a field technician in Manhattan for a company called MicroCare. 
    In my free time, I like to listen to music and hang out with friends.</p>

    <p>I am taking this course because I feel like this class would help me understand more about how websites are structured and learn ways to further my education rather than just my required courses.
    I have taken CIT 221 and 231, so I have some basic experience with SQL, HTML, CSS, Java, and Javascript. Outside of Pace, I coded for my high school robotics team in C++ and LabView.
    
    I am interested in pursuing a career in Cyber-Security after I graduate Pace. I hope to become a Security Engineer or Architect, but I still have a lot to learn before either of those could ever happen.
